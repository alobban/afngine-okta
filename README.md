# AFNgine




## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the afngine repository and install the dependencies:

### Prerequisites

In order to get up and running your system must have Node and NPM installed. As an addition step, I like to have [NVM (Node Version Manager)](https://www.liquidweb.com/kb/how-to-install-nvm-node-version-manager-for-node-js-on-centos-7/) installed. Once completed, run:

    $ nvm install <node version>

### Clone AFNgine

Clone the afngine repository using [git][git]:

    $ git clone git@bitbucket.org:afnllc/afngine.git

Then run:

    $ cd afngine
    $ npm install
    $ npm install -g http-server

Finally to run the app:
	$ http-server ./app/ -p 8000
